It's daybreak, 5:32
And I lie awake wondering what happened to you
Tried to call you on your mobile phone
Straight to answer and the twilight zone

It's only my opinion, but I can see your point of view
And if you saw mine too, we'd have a basis to
Change places and celebrate the races

And learn to love
All the million things that make us different
There's so much love

Let's get along, baby, get along
Let's get along together
You gotta sing, sing along, maybe get it wrong
Oh, let's get along, baby, get it on
Let's get along, baby, get along
Oh, let's get along, baby, we belong together

Let's get along together

With your brown skin, yes, you're beautiful
And your blonde hair like a waterfall
And you didn't feel free at school
Learning ideas that separate us all

So you flew south, down to Mexico
Tried to live like Frida Kahlo
Living every day and all the disability
Celebrating life and all its fragility

Oh, I know
All the million things that make us different
There's so much love

Let's get along, baby, get along
Let's get along together
You gotta sing, sing along, maybe get it wrong
Oh, let's get along, baby, get it on
Let's get along, baby, get along
Oh, let's get along together
You gotta sing, sing along, maybe get it wrong
Oh, let's get along, baby, we belong together

Yeah

Let's get along together
Let's get along together
Let's get along together

Yeah
Let's get along, baby, get along
Oh, let's get along, baby, we belong together, yeah
