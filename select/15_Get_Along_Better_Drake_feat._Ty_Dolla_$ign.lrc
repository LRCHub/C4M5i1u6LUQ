[00:04.21] Uh
[00:05.35] This might be too real, too real
[00:21.35] 
[00:13.78] Hold me closer in these
[00:19.13] Trying times, supposed to be mine
[00:23.59] Baby
[00:27.15] I need some help just like anyone else
[00:31.96] Hold me closer in these
[00:35.01] Trying times, open your eyes
[00:39.78] Baby
[00:42.87] You said you felt something for me (Talk to 'em)
[00:50.09] I don't know when
[00:53.31] Based on the signals you send
[00:56.80] Based on the way you apologize
[01:00.92] When you came to see me and then (Then what?)
[01:05.50] You had the nerve to defend (Defend what?)
[01:09.96] Mistakes that you made at the end
[01:13.12] You said I was too invested
[01:16.33] And that's what had forced you to go and pretend
[01:19.96] I swear you crazy
[01:21.90] Someone that's close to you reached out to me just
[01:24.31] To see if we had made amends (Oh)
[01:40.81] 
[01:28.84] Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
[01:32.80] But now I get along better with your friend (Woo)
[01:38.84] And it's wrong, I know (Know, know, know)
[01:42.82] But again (Ooh, yeah)
[01:45.97] Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
[01:49.81] I get along better with your friend (Oh)
[01:54.73] And it's wrong, I know, it's wrong, I know, oh
[02:17.73] 
[02:02.92] No
[02:10.03] You said you felt, you said you felt
[02:13.61] Something that's different from everyone else
[02:17.74] You had the nerve to still ask for my help
[02:19.98] Dug you out ditches, you buried yourself, ah-oh
[02:27.50] You said you fell
[02:30.18] And I took your word that night in our hotel
[02:34.08] One thing about time, surely, time's gonna tell
[02:38.46] Never had to work for much, so you said it yourself, ah-oh, oh
[02:44.14] Can't let it go, can't get this out of me
[02:47.79] This shit still bothers me
[02:49.84] Don't you dare (Don't you dare)
[02:51.81] Don't say you're proud of me
[02:53.99] That shit's not real to me
[02:55.75] Now you wanna come crack to me (Crack, crack)
[02:59.52] Three whole years after me
[03:02.22] Why did you wait 'til the end?
[03:17.22] 
[03:05.34] Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
[03:09.58] But now I get along better with your friend, friend
[03:15.24] And it don't feel wrong, but again
[03:19.98] Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
[03:25.54] I get along better with your friend
[03:30.64] Oh, and it's wrong, I know, but again
[03:36.69] Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
[03:42.49] I get along better with your friend
